"""Brick 0 — prove the grounding spine on a 2-line test corpus.

Answers one on-corpus question, refuses one off-corpus question. This does NOT
use the real corpus; it points the loader at a tiny throwaway corpus so we're
testing the MECHANISM before the content exists. Run from the repo root:

    ./.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m scripts.smoke_brick0
